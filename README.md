# long-short-term-memory
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is capable of remembering long-term dependencies in sequential data by using memory cells, gates, and a hidden state to control the flow of information. It is widely used in time series analysis, natural language processing, and other tasks.
